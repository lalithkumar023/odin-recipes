    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 cup basmati rice, washed and soaked for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>250g chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon biryani masala powder (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 green chili, slit</li>
        <li>A small handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>A small handful of fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
            <p>In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, half of the biryani masala powder, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, half of the chopped coriander leaves, half of the chopped mint leaves, and salt.</p>
            <p>Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sauté Onions and Spices:</strong>
            <p>Heat ghee or oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick) and sauté for a minute until fragrant.</p>
            <p>Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>
            <p>Add the marinated chicken along with the marinade to the pot. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken starts to brown slightly.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>
            <strong>Layer and Cook the Rice:</strong>
            <p>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Gently mix everything together to coat the rice with the chicken and spices.</p>
            <p>Add the chopped tomato, green chili, and remaining biryani masala powder. Mix well.</p>
            <p>Pour water over the mixture. Check for salt and adjust seasoning if needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Simmer and Dum Cooking:</strong>
            <p>Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Avoid stirring during this time to prevent the rice from breaking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Check Doneness:</strong>
            <p>After 15-20 minutes, turn off the heat and let the biryani sit, covered, for another 5-10 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the residual heat to finish cooking the rice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong>
            <p>Serve hot as is or with raita (yogurt dip) or salad on the side.</p>
        </li>                   
    </ol>
