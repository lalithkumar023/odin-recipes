    <h2>Recipe for a perfectly cripsy Dosai</h2>
    <p>Making a crispy dosa involves a few key steps and tips to get it just right. Here's a basic recipe and some tips to achieve crispy dosas: <p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>cup rice (any variety, but typically a short-grain rice like sona masuri or idli rice)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preparation:</strong>
            <p>Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds thoroughly under running water.</p>
            <p>Soak them together in enough water for about 6-8 hours or overnight. The soaking helps in easy grinding and fermentation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Grinding:</strong>
            <p>After soaking, drain the water and grind the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds into a smooth batter. Add water as needed to get a smooth, slightly thick consistency.</p>
            <p>The batter should not be too runny.</p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Fermentation:</strong>
            <p>Cover the bowl loosely and let it ferment in a warm place for about 8-12 hours or until it doubles in volume.</p>
            <p>The fermentation process is crucial for the dosas to turn out crispy.</p>
        </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Making Dosai:</strong>
            <p>Heat a non-stick or cast iron dosa tawa (griddle) over medium-high heat.</p>
            <p>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the hot tawa. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.</p> 
            <p>You can make it as thin as possible for crispier dosas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Folding:</strong>
            <p>Using a flat spatula, gently loosen the edges of the dosa. Once it's crisp and golden brown, carefully fold it in half or roll it into a cylinder.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
